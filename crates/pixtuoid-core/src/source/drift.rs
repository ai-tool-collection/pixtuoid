//! Structured **decode-drift breadcrumbs** — the single source of truth for the
//! source self-diagnosis layer. Every site where the upstream wire format
//! surprises us emits ONE `tracing` event with a stable `target` + `kind` +
//! `source`, so:
//!   - the persistent warn-floor log captures it (read by `pixtuoid doctor`), and
//!   - a future counting `tracing::Layer` can tally it for the live TUI footer,
//!
//! WITHOUT any decoder signature change — the emit is an ambient side effect, so
//! the per-source `fn(&Value) -> Result<Vec<AgentEvent>>` seam (invariant #3)
//! is untouched. This is layer 2 of the upstream-drift defense ("self-monitoring
//! from the real stream", `pixtuoid-core/CLAUDE.md`) finally made VISIBLE instead
//! of stranded in a log nobody reads — the gap the Task→Agent rename exposed.
//!
//! `source` is a static `REGISTERED_SOURCES` name (safe). The free-form values
//! (`name`/`field`/`tool`/`detail`) are untrusted wire content — every consumer
//! sanitizes (the headless path's `sanitize_line`, the footer's cell buffer).

/// The `tracing` target every drift breadcrumb shares. Consumers (the log scan
/// in `pixtuoid doctor`, the future counting Layer, the footer) key on it.
